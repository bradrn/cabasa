== Introduction

Cabasa is an application for the simulation of arbitrary 2D cellular
automata.

[[sec:whatisca]]
=== What is a Cellular Automaton?

*Note:* You can skip this section if you already know about cellular
automata.

A _cellular automaton_ (abbreviated from now on as CA/CAs) is a type of
mathematical simulation which operates on a set of _cells_. The cells
are arranged in some sort of lattice (typically a 1D line or a 2D grid).
Each cell has an associated _state_, which is one value drawn from a
predefined set of values.

On each step of the simulation, a fixed set of rules is applied. Each
step is referred to as a _generation_. A pattern starts at generation 0,
and each time the rules are applied the generation is increased by one.

To illustrate this, consider the well-known CA known as _Conway’s Game
of Life_ (or _Life_ for short). This CA takes place on a 2D grid. Each
cell in this grid has a state drawn from a set of two states, usually
called `Alive' and `Dead'. Each generation, the grid evolves according
to the following rules:

1. [[gold3]] If the current cell is dead but exactly
three of the surrounding cells are alive, then the cell becomes alive.
2. [[goldo]] Otherwise a dead cell stays dead.
3. [[gola23]] If the current cell is alive and two or
three of the surrounding cells are alive, then the cell stays alive.
4. [[golao]] Otherwise a live cell turns into a dead
cell.

The effect of these rules can be seen in Figure [TODO],
which shows the effect of one application of the above rules on a small
starting pattern. Dead cells are drawn in white and live cells are drawn
in blue.

To illustrate the rules more clearly, in Figure [TODO]
one live cell is highlighted in red. Its eight surrounding cells are
highlighted in a lighter colour. If we consider the middle cell, we can
see that it is next to only one live cell, so by the
Rule 4 above it turns into a dead cell.
Figure [TODO] is similar, except that a dead cell is
highlighted instead of a live cell. This cell has three neighbouring
live cells, so by Rule 1 it becomes alive in the
next generation.

=== About Cabasa

Cabasa is an application for running *2D* cellular automata on (at the
moment) a *finite* grid. It aims to support any CA, unlike existing
applications which can only support certain classes of CAs. Do note that
it does not aim to be particularly fast; if you want a very fast
simulator, another application is probably better.

[[chap:qstart]]
== Quickstart

To select a new rule, press the menu:Control[Set Rule] menu item. This opens a rule-selection
dialog, where you can type a rule in or select a preexisting rule.
Cabasa comes with a set of predefined rules; to select one of these, use
the menu item menu:File[Open]. In this example, we’ll use the `life.alp` rule; it
implements the _Game of Life_ rule described in
Section <<sec:whatisca>>. Selecting this rule and pressing the btn:[OK]
button will make its contents appear in the dialog. Press the btn:[Set Rule]
button to change the current rule to the rule which you have selected.

Now we can draw a pattern on the grid to use with this rule. Select
state `1` from the dropdown box at the top of the window marked '`Current
drawing state`' (see screenshot, Figure [TODO]). After this
you should be able to draw patterns on the grid. If you press the key,
you can click and drag to move around; pressing gets you back to drawing
mode.

To run the selected CA rule on your pattern, press the triangular btn:[Play]
button on the left of the screen; pressing it again should pause the
evolution. You should observe the pattern changing; this is due to the
repeated application of the _Game of Life_ rules as described above.

[[chap:gstart]]
== Getting Started

[[sec:ui]]
=== User interface

image::screenshot.png[Cabasa Main Window,float="right",align="center"]

The main window, shown on Figure [TODO], is composed of
several parts.

The large grid in the middle shows the current state of the CA grid. The
user can draw on the grid, move around to show the rest of the grid, and
use the currently loaded CA to evolve the pattern shown on the grid.

The information pane, just below the menu, shows various pieces of
information about the current application state. Currently it only shows
the current generation, but it is expected that it will contain more
information in future versions of Cabasa.

The drawing options pane, below the information pane, shows options
related to drawing. Again, there is currently only one thing shown here,
but future versions may add more. This pane will be disabled if drawing
mode is not enabled.

[[sec:drming]]
=== Drawing and Moving

The application starts in _drawing mode_. In this mode, clicking and
dragging on the grid changes the state of each cell the cursor passes
over.

By default, the grid starts with all grid cells set to state 0 and the
_drawing state_ also set to 0, so nothing happens when you try to draw
on the grid. However, by changing the selected state (next to the text
'`Current drawing state`'), other states can be chosen. For instance, if
state 1 is selected, then clicking and dragging on the grid will change
the cells under the cursor to state 1. Note that the states are numbered
starting from 0, not 1, so to select e.g. the second state you have
declared you need to select state 1, not state 2.

Moving around the grid requires another mode, _move mode_. This mode can
be selected from the menu:Draw[Mode] menu, or by pressing the kbd:[M] key. You can get back to
drawing mode by using the menu:Draw menu, or by pressing the kbd:[D] key. In this mode,
clicking and dragging will not draw on the grid, but rather will move or
pan around the grid. Enabling this mode will also disable the '`drawing
options`' pane.

In any mode, you can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel. Scroll
up over a point to zoom in to that point, and scroll down to zoom out.

If you zoom out far enough, you will notice that the grid abruptly comes
to an end at a certain point. This is because the grid is finite.
However, the grid `wraps around' at its edges; that is, if you move off
one edge of the grid, you reappear at the opposite edge. For instance,
the cell immediately above the topmost cell is considered to be the
bottommost cell.

[[sec:gridsize]]
=== Changing the Grid Size

By default, Cabasa uses a 100 × 100 grid (unless this
has been changed in the . This may be changed using the menu:Edit[Change Grid Size] menu item, which
launches a '`Change Size`' dialog. This dialog may be used by entering the
new size as '`width × height`', then
pressing btn:[OK] (or btn:[Cancel] if you actually don’t want to change the
size).

[[sec:selcopy]]
=== Selection and copying

In addition to the two modes described above, there is also a mode for
selecting parts of the grid. This _selection mode_ may be accessed via
the menu:Draw[Mode] menu, like the other two modes, or with the kbd[S] hotkey. In this mode,
you may click and drag to select a portion of the grid (shown in green).
Click and drag again in a different part of the grid to make a new
selection. To clear the current selection, use the menu:Draw[Clear Selection] menu item, or its
hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+K].

Once you have selected part of a grid, you may _copy_ it into the
_clipboard_, with the purpose of _pasting_ it back into another part of
the grid. To copy the selection, use the menu:Edit[Copy] menu item. To paste your
selection back, press menu:Edit[Paste]; a brown overlay will then be shown at the
location where your selection will be pasted. Move your mouse, and then
click on your document to paste your selection at the shown location.
The usual hotkeys kbd:[Ctrl+C] and kbd:[Ctrl+V] respectively may also be used.

[[sec:chngrule]]
=== Changing the Rule

The current CA can be changed using the menu:Control[Set Rule] menu item. This opens a window
where you can type in a specification of a CA rule using the ALPACA
specification language.

To accept a specification, press the btn:[Set Rule] button at the bottom of
the window. This will interpret the specification and load it into the
main window. If the specification is invalid, it will show an error
dialog instead.

After the rule is set, you will be able to draw patterns in this rule on
the grid in the main window. The set of states available for drawing
through the '`current drawing state`' option will change to reflect the
new rule. Since the set of allowed states could have changed, the grid
will be cleared after each rule change.

For more details on how to specify a CA, see Chapter <<sec:speccas>>,
but if you want to play around with a specification now then you can
copy the following Game of Life specification into the '`Set Rule`'
window:

....
state Dead  " "
  to Alive when 3 Alive and 5 Dead;
state Alive "*"
  to Dead when 4 Alive or 7 Dead.
....

[[sec:running]]
=== Running CAs

A set of _control buttons_ can be seen on the left of the window. These
buttons are used to actually run the CA once a rule has been loaded and
a pattern has been drawn.

To run one generation of the CA, use the middle button. This operation
is called _stepping_. You can repeatedly press this button to run the
rules more than once.

The topmost button will repeatedly step the CA when it is pressed once.
This operation is generally referred to as _running_ the CA. After this
button has been pressed, the icon will change to a pause icon. As this
suggests, the button can be pressed again to pause the CA. Pressing it
again will allow the CA to be run again.

To adjust the rate of running, use the menu:Control[Faster] and menu:Control[Slower] menu items. Alternatively,
you may press the kbd:[+] or kbd[-] keys respectively. The current speed is shown at
the top of the window as the delay between steps; that is, a smaller
number indicates a faster speed. Do note that Cabasa will not let you
increase the speed below 100, since at these fast speeds Cabasa may
crash when it attempts to calculate too quickly.

To reset the CA after you have run or stepped it, use the bottom btn:[reset]
button. This button will restore the original state of the CA after you
have pressed the btn:[step] or btn:[run] buttons. If you haven’t run the CA,
then it doesn’t do anything.

To clear the pattern, use the menu:Draw[Clear] menu item. This resets the generation,
clears the pattern and moves the grid so that the top-left corner is
displayed (as in the start of the program).

[[sec:opsav]]
=== Opening and Saving

Cabasa has the ability to open and save both rules and patterns. This
can be done through the menu:File[Open] and menu:File[Save] menu items on the CA specification window
and main window respectively. _Save_ (as opposed to _save as_)
functionality has not yet been implemented, but will be implemented in a
later version of Cabasa.

In more detail:

* To *save the current rule*, use the menu:control[Set rule] menu item on the main window to
open the CA selection window. Then press the menu:File[Save] menu item on the CA
selection window to show a file selection dialog where you can save the
current rule.
* To *open a previously saved rule*, use the menu:Control[Set rule] menu item on the main
window to open the CA selection window. Then press the menu:File[Open] menu item on the
CA selection window to show a file selection dialog where you can open a
previously saved rule. After the rule has been opened, press the _Set
Rule_ button at the bottom of the window to load it as the current rule.
* To *save the current pattern*, use the menu:File[Save As] menu item on the main window to
show a file selection dialog where you can save the current pattern.
* To *open a previously saved pattern*, use the menu:File[Open] menu item on the main
window to show a file selection dialog where you can open a previously
saved pattern. If the pattern has been saved with a different rule to
the rule currently active, a dialog box will be shown asking you if you
want to switch rules.

[[sec:findrs]]
==== Finding rules

If Cabasa needs to find a previously-saved rule (as may occur when
e.g. opening a saved pattern), it uses the following steps to find it:

. Inspect the folder specified by the `User-defined rules directory`
setting (see Section <<sec:sets>>); use the rule if it is found in
this folder.
. Inspect the folder specified by the `Predefined rules directory`
setting (see Section <<sec:sets>>); use the rule if it is found in
this folder.
. The rule could not be found in any known folder; ask the user if they
want to find it manually.

[[sec:sets]]
=== Settings

Cabasa can be customised through the use of various settings. These can
be accessed through the menu:File[Settings] menu item. The following settings are currently
supported:

Predefined rules directory::
  The directory in which sample rules are stored. (See
  Section <<sec:findrs>> for details.)
User-defined rules directory::
  The directory in which user-defined rules are stored. (See
  Section <<sec:findrs>> for details.)
Default grid size::
  A default grid size of _x_ × _y_ causes the default
  grid to have a size of _x_ columns by _y_
  rows. Note that changing this setting does _not_ have any effect on
  the current grid; it only takes effect if a new grid is made.

[[chap:speccas]]
== Specifying CAs

[[sec:usalp]]
=== Using ALPACA

ALPACA is a language created by Chris Pressey specifically for the
specification of CAs. Cabasa uses the ALPACA language to specify CAs;
currently Cabasa supports ALPACA version 1.1. Cabasa currently supports
ALPACA version 1.1.

The reference manual for ALPACA version 1.1 is a very good guide for
learning about the various features of ALPACA. It is available at the
following web address:
https://github.com/catseye/ALPACA/blob/0b2d57b8739dc240969c62c8e1cd13c1863770e0/doc/ALPACA.markdown.
Cabasa should support all the features outlined in that manual *except*
for the initial configuration, which is currently ignored.

Do note however that for technical reasons,
  footnote:[In more detail: the '`examples`' are actually runnable tests containing an embedded description of the expected output as well.]
  the '`examples`' in the ALPACA
manual are actually written in a format called '`Falderal`' and not plain
ALPACA; the ALPACA translation can be found by reading the parts of the
example which are after the `|` characters. For instance, take this
example from the manual:

....
| state Space " ";
| state Up "U"
|   to ^ when true;
| state Down "D"
|   to v when true
| begin
| DDD
| UUU
= -----
= UUU
= DDD
= -----
....

For this example, the ALPACA which you would actually type is the
following portion:

....
state Space " ";
state Up "U"
  to ^ when true;
state Down "D"
  to v when true
begin
DDD
UUU
....

[[sec:stys]]
=== Using ALPACA Stylesheets

The _ALPACA Stylesheets_ format is a simple way to change the styling of
a CA specified using ALPACA. The format is documented at
https://github.com/catseye/ALPACA/blob/0b2d57b8739dc240969c62c8e1cd13c1863770e0/doc/ALPACA.markdown#alpaca-stylesheets-10.

To open the ALPACA Stylesheets window, use the menu:Draw[Edit Stylesheets] menu item. This opens a
window where you can edit the current stylesheet using the textbox in
the middle of the screen, and then set it using the btn:[Set Stylesheet]
button at the bottom. You can also use the menu:File[Open] and menu:File[Save As] menu items to open and
save stylesheets respectively.

[[chap:samps]]
== Sample Patterns and Rules

Cabasa comes with a set of predefined example patterns and rules. These
are located in the default pattern and rule directories, so to access
them you can simply use the relevant menu:File[Open] menu items.

The predefined rules are:

life.alp::
  An ALPACA implementation of Conway’s Game of Life
bbrain.alp::
  An ALPACA implementation of _Brian’s Brain_, another well-known CA.
  This CA tends to explode chaotically, creating fascinating dynamic
  patterns.
wireworld.alp::
  An ALPACA implementation of _Wireworld_, a CA designed to simulate
  computer circuits. For more information on WireWorld, see
  https://www.quinapalus.com/wires0.html
life.hs::
  A Haskell implementation of Conway’s Game of Life. This in particular
  is a good template to start coding a CA in Haskell.
langton.hs::
  A Haskell implementation of _Langton’s Ant_, a well-known CA
  simulating a moving `ant'. For more information on Langton’s Ant, see
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

The predefined patterns are:

pi.mcl and r.mcl::
  The _pi-heptomino_ and _r-pentomino_, two patterns which evolve in an
  interesting way when run using Conway’s Game of Life.
gates.mcl::
  The and and or logic gates in Wireworld.
langton.mcl::
  An initial configuration for Langton’s Ant.
